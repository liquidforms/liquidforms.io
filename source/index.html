                Do the web form solutions you've found make you sad? Do you wish you could just define which field names you want and use your own markup? Do other solutions leak their branding into your site?
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you want simple forms that <em>just work?</em>

                You know what you want to build. So build it! Just tell us which field names you want to use in your form and that's it. You can use whatever markup you want!
            </p>
            <p>
                There may be an extra field or two that you may need to add but for the most part we use a light touch when it comes to how you build your form on your site.

                <h1>Extremely Simple Form Builder</h1>
                <h2>Our KISS approach to handling forms</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                If you are looking to build <em>simple</em> forms for your static websites then Liquid Forms is for you. If you subscribe to the KISS principle you'll feel right at home with Liquid Forms. With just a few simple field types you can still build incredibly powerful forms without all of the fuss.

                <h2>We like to stay out of the way</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Whether you choose to redirect on submission or leverage our rich AJAX API, the focus is on <strong>you</strong> and <strong>your brand</strong>. In fact, we go well out of our way to stay out of the way by limiting the amount of validation we do on your form submissions so we do not have to provide a customized form entry experience for your users.

                <h2>Because KISS</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Validation of form submissions is serious business. That said, handling form submission errors is hard. :( So we do very little of it. The end result is an experience that is simple for you, your users, and us! We all win!
            </p>
            <p>
                We're not <em>crazy</em>, though. We do some validation and some sanity checking, but for the most part we believe in very liberal rules for web forms. We're not building an e-commerce site or anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>If you need complicated validation rules and are not happy relying on client-side validation for this, Liquid Forms may not be for you!</em>

            </header>
            <p>
                Since you are deploying static sites you are probably aware of some of the benefits of not having to manage a dynamic site. Less maintenance. Not having to worry about databases being down. You know, the usual stuff. Why bring all of that into the mix again for your static sites just to process a form or two when we can do all of the hard work for you?

                As the creators of <a href="https://sculpin.io">Sculpin</a>, a static site generator written in PHP, we take static sites very seriously. We built Liquid Forms for ourselves because other solutions just weren't that fun to work with. We think you'll enjoy Liquid Forms as much as we do!
